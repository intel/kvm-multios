# Automated Windows VM Installation
The automated Windows guest VM automated installation will perform the following:
- install Windows from Windows installer iso (modified for No Prompt installation).
- configure VM for KVM MultiOS Portfolio release supported features.
- install Windows GFX and SR-IOV ZeroCopy drivers for Intel GPU (if --no-sriov install option is not given).

The created image is default able to work launching Windows VM with GPU SR-IOV virtualization (if --no-sriov install option is not given).

**
Information:  
For using created image with GVT-d, user may need to re-run Intel graphics installer after launching Windows VM with GVT-d via Remote Desktop connection to the VM, then reboot VM to get physical display output with GVT-d. **

## Prerequisites
Required:
- Windows noprompt installer iso file created in [NoPrompt Windows Installation ISO Creation](#noprompt-windows-installation-iso-creation)
- Windows update OS patch msu file as per host platform BSP release guide
- Intel Graphics driver 64bit release 7z/zip archive for host platform
- Intel Graphics SR-IOV ZeroCopy driver zip archive for host platform

Host platform DUT setup:
- Host platform have physical display monitor connection with working display prior to installation run (unless VNC only install option is desired).
- Host platform is setup as per platform release BSP guide and booted accordingly to GUI desktop after login.
- Host platform has network connection and Internet access and proxy variables (http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy) are set appropriately in /etc/environment if required for network access.
- Host platform has Internet apt access. ie. Running "sudo apt update" worked successfully.
- Host platform date/time is set up properly to current date/time.
- Host platform is already setup for using KVM MultiOS Portfolio release as per instructions [here](README.md#host-setup).

### NoPrompt Windows Installation ISO Creation
Windows installation iso as downloaded from Windows direct is not suitable for unattended install as it requires human intervention to respond to a "Press Any Key To Boot From..." prompt from iso installation.
To get around this, an NoPrompt Windows installation iso needs to be generated once from the actual installation iso provided by Windows download for unattended Windows installation. The created NoPrompt iso could be reused for all subsequent unattended Windows VM creation from same Windows ISO.

The generation of NoPrompt installation iso requires the use of a Windows machine with Windows ADK installed.
Reference: https://www.deploymentresearch.com/a-good-iso-file-is-a-quiet-iso-file

1. Install [Windows ADK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#choose-the-right-adk-for-your-scenario) in Windows machine according to version of Windows installation iso to be used.
Take note of ADK installation destination path for later use.

| Windows Version | Window ADK Download |
| :-- | :-- |
| Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 21H2 | [Windows ADK for Windows 10, version 2004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120254)</br>[Windows PE add-on for the ADK, version 2004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120253)|
| Windows 11 IoT Enterprise 22H2 | [Windows ADK for Windows 11, version 22H2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196127)</br>[Windows PE add-on for the ADK, version 22H2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196224)|

2. Download and save Create-NoPromptISO.ps1 script from [here](https://github.com/DeploymentResearch/DRFiles/raw/906151a1cdd55a14bc226196a3f597b0538273dd/Scripts/Create-NoPromptISO.ps1)

3. Edit WinPE_InputISOfile, WinPE_OutputISOfile and ADK_Path variables in CreateNoPromptISO.ps1 script with appropriate paths for input ISO file, output ISO file and ADK installation path on your Windows machine accordingly.

        notepad CreateNoPromptISO.ps1

        ...
        $WinPE_InputISOfile = "C:\ISO\Zero Touch WinPE 10 x64.iso"
        $WinPE_OutputISOfile = "C:\ISO\Zero Touch WinPE 10 x64 - NoPrompt.iso"

        $ADK_Path = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit"

4. Open a PowerShell terminal in Windows machine and run CreateNoPromptISO.ps1 script

        cd <CreateNoPromptISO.ps1 location>
        .\CreateNoPromptISO.ps1

        Note: If you see "CreateNoPromptISO.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system" error,
        run the following command in PowerShell prior to running CreateNoPromptISO.ps1.

        Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

The noprompt installation iso will be generated at path specified by WinPE_OutputISOfile variable in CreateNoPromptISO.ps1 script. This can be used for all subsequent Windows unattended installations.

### Getting Ready for Automated Install
#### Copy required files to unattend_winxx folder on the Intel host machine which is to run the guest VM.
#### Please take note:
#### - All the folders mentioned below are relative to the git repository
#### - For Windows 10, use folder "./guest_setup/ubuntu/unattend_win10"
#### - For Windows 11, use folder "./guest_setup/ubuntu/unattend_win11"
1. Go to the git repository folder.

        cd <git repository>

2. Copy windows noprompt installer iso to unattend_winxx folder, ensure renaming as below.

        cp <windowsNoPrompt.iso> ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/windowsNoPrompt.iso

3. Copy required Windows update OS patch msu file to unattend folder, ensure renaming as below.

        cp <windows-kbxxxxxxx-x64_xxxxxxxxxxx.msu> ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/windows-updates.msu

4. Copy required Intel GPU GFX driver archive to unattend folder, ensure renaming as below.

        cp <Driver-Release-64-bit.zip> ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/Driver-Release-64-bit.zip
        OR
        cp <Driver-Release-64-bit.7z> ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/Driver-Release-64-bit.7z

5. Copy required Intel GPU SR-IOV Zero-copy driver build or installer archive to unattend folder, ensure renaming as below.

6. Configure any additional driver/windows installations by modifying ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/additional_installs.yaml.
   Only installations which are capable of silent install without any user intervention required are supported for auto install.  
   Additional_install.yaml file has the format as below. 

        installations:
          - name: # unique name (in single word) for this installation in yaml
            description: # description of installation
            filename: # filename of file in ./guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx> folder containing install file.
                      # If file is not present, attempt to download from download_url and rename as filename.
                      # If download fails, auto install will be aborted.
            download_url: # Empty string or download url to download installation file
            install_type: # msi | exe | cab | inf
            install_file: # path to installation msi/exe/cab/inf file(s) inside archive/folder to install with
                          # If "path_to\*.inf" is used as file, all inf inside install_file path + subdirs will be installed
            silent_install_option: # '' or options required to run silent installation as per installation guide
            enable_test_sign: # yes | no.

   Currently the default additional installations are provided for:
   - Intel速 Wireless Bluetooth速 for IT Administrators version
   - Intel速 PROSet/Wireless Software and Drivers for IT Admins
   - Intel速 Ethernet Adapter Complete Driver Pack

   If do not wish to have any of above additional installations, please remove accordingly in guest_setup/ubuntu/<unattend_winxx>/additional_installs.yaml file prior to starting Windows Automated install.

Now system is ready to run Windows Automated install. Run Windows automated install as per following sections based on what type of VM support is desired and whether provided Intel GPU GFX driver used for installation is WHQL certifed or non-WHQL certified aka attest-signed.

Refer to here for information on WHQL certified vs Intel attest-signed graphics driver: [What Is the Difference between WHQL and Non-WHQL Certified Graphics Drivers?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000093158/graphics.html#summary)

## Running Windows Automated Install
**Note: VM will restart multiple times and finally shutdown automatically after completion. Installation may take some time, please be patient. 
As part of windows installation process VM may be restarted in SR-IOV mode for installation of SR-IOV required drivers in the background. At this stage VM will no longer have display on virt-viewer UI nor on VNC. Instead VM display could be found on host platform physical monitor.
DO NOT interfere or use VM before setup script exits successfully.**
